# SXSW Sydney Chainference

## Connecting creative industries professionals beyond the event

SXSW Sydney brings together innovators in technology, film, music, and interactive media. Through Chainference, we're supporting continued connections and follow-up activities for attendees.

## About SXSW Sydney

The festival runs annually, featuring panels, workshops, screenings, and networking opportunities across creative industries.

For more information about the event, visit the [official SXSW Sydney website](https://www.sxswsydney.com/).

## Chainference Focus: Local Meetups

Following SXSW Sydney, our Chainference activities center on facilitating local meetups where attendees can:

- **Reconnect**: Meet fellow attendees in their own cities
- **Share Insights**: Discuss key takeaways and ideas from the festival
- **Build Networks**: Strengthen professional connections made at SXSW
- **Continue Conversations**: Extend discussions that started during the event

## Upcoming Local Meetups

We're organizing meetups in various Australian cities for SXSW Sydney attendees. Locations and dates will be announced soon.

### Why Local Meetups?
- **Accessibility**: Easier for people to attend events in their own cities
- **Deeper Connections**: More meaningful follow-up than virtual alternatives
- **Community Building**: Strengthen the creative industries ecosystem locally
