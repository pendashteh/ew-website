# Chainference for auIGF

## Supporting the Australian Internet Governance Forum ecosystem

Chainference for auIGF is our collaborative layer that strengthens the Australian Internet Governance Forum and its community.

In our ecosystem, conferences like auIGF are thoughtfully designed, carefully delivered, and deeply valued. Each event has its own identity, goals, culture, and constraints—and organisers already carry a significant responsibility in bringing them to life.

At the same time, we observe a shared reality:
- The people who attend, speak at, volunteer for, and organise auIGF overlap significantly with other internet governance events
- Engagement naturally begins *before* auIGF and often wants to continue *after* it
- Some opportunities for connection and value exist beyond the scope of any single IGF event

Chainference for auIGF exists to support this reality—not to critique it.

## What we mean by Chainference for auIGF

**Chainference** is our name for a voluntary, ecosystem‑initiated layer that sits *alongside* auIGF.

It is designed to:
- **Align with auIGF organisers**, not direct or override them
- **Respect full ownership** of conference design, content, delivery, and intellectual property
- **Reduce effort**, not add complexity
- **Increase value for audiences**, speakers, and volunteers

Chainference does not replace existing processes, brands, or decisions. It complements them.

## Clear boundaries, by design

From the outset, Chainference is intentionally scoped to avoid grey areas.

We do **not**:
- Make decisions about auIGF programs
- Influence acceptance or rejection of talks
- Control messaging, branding, or delivery
- Use or redistribute non‑public materials
- Claim ownership over ideas, content, or outcomes

auIGF organisers retain full control and IP at all times.

Our role is supportive, optional, and transparent.

## Where Chainference helps most for auIGF

Chainference focuses on areas where collective effort can add value *without interfering* with organiser workflows.

### Before auIGF
- Facilitating **grassroots ideation spaces** that help potential speakers explore internet governance themes and shape ideas
- Supporting **call‑for‑papers readiness** by lowering barriers to participation
- Helping organisers reach engaged, prepared contributors

### Around auIGF
- Encouraging cross‑community awareness and participation
- Strengthening relationships between aligned IGF events and audiences

### After auIGF
- Creating opt‑in spaces for **post-auIGF reflection and learning**
- Supporting continued engagement around publicly available content
- Helping auIGF impact extend beyond event dates

All participation is voluntary and aligned with organiser intent.

## Why this works best at an ecosystem level

Some forms of value are inherently collective:
- Long‑term speaker development in internet governance
- Volunteer discovery across IGF events
- Knowledge continuity between conferences
- Community momentum that spans years, not days

These are difficult for any single IGF to sustain alone—even with strong resources.

Chainference exists to hold this shared layer, so conferences can focus on what they do best.

## What we have done so far for auIGF

We are intentionally starting small and responsibly.

### Grassroots ideation for Calls for Papers
We facilitate open, community‑driven ideation sessions where participants:
- Explore auIGF themes together
- Develop early‑stage session ideas
- Gain confidence and clarity before submitting proposals

This often results in stronger, more thoughtful submissions—without adding work for organisers.

### auIGF debriefing sessions
We organise debriefing sessions around **auIGF content** that matter to the collective.

These events:
- Extend the life of auIGF discussions
- Create shared learning experiences
- Introduce internet governance topics to new audiences respectfully

## Upcoming events:

**Debriefing session No. 1**    
November 2025

## An open invitation

Chainference for auIGF is an invitation, not an obligation.

If you organise IGF-related events and:
- Care about your community beyond event dates
- Want to increase the impact of your call for papers
- Are curious about collective approaches that respect your autonomy

We would love to explore how Chainference can support *your* goals.

Our intention is simple:

> **Help IGF events create more value for their audiences—together—while staying fully in your control.**

Chainference is not an event.
It is not a brand overlay.

It is a shared practice for a healthier internet governance ecosystem.
